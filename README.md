Description:
Academic Project for the course Optical Fibres for high speed communication. In this project we designed a sensor module to measure a flow and depth of liquid in a tank is developed and tested. The
sensor is based on the optical technique which operates on optical intensity modulation. On the basis of change in intensity at a particular level from that at the surface, depth of the liquid is calculated. The amount of water in the tank at a particular point which is referred as flow is determined based on the depth of the water. Experimental results, simulated graphs are also obtained using MATLAB.
